When the mod is first installed, or when new genes are added, existing entities are assumed to have the _first_ allele listed. Ordering does not matter aside from which is first. When choosing names, I recommend calling the first allele "wildtype" if it is the wildtype, or otherwise calling it "standard".

Avoid naming any alleles "default", because the gene initializer uses that as a keyword. Suggested alternatives: "wildtype", "standard", "N".
